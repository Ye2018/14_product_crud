# 14_product_crud

This project is for learning and training purpose, inspired by the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eebptXfEvw). If you like his tutorial, please give him a thumb up.

In this repository, I stored the codes I got when I followed his intructions step by step. However, since I use wamp as my local server rather than xampp, the coded stored here is a little different from the instructor's. Plus, since we are using different version of PHP, some syntax is modified. The typical thing is the use of *ternary*. Instead of:

```php

$myAge = $age ?? 18;

```

,we use:

```php

$myAge = $age ?: 18;

```

In each of the subfolder, I will write a log.md to record useful comments and links. I hope this will be helpful for the beginners like me. Let's work together to build up our own community.

To beginners like me, my personal opinion is the *bad* version of the project is the most important edition, because tons of fundamental concepts are presented in this one. Those fundamental ideas includes how to connnect a database, how the php interact with html, how to make use of tools like bootstrap and the logic between each of the components, etc. For this reason, I strongly suggest, after we finish writing the codes, we need to review it so that we can establish a big picture in mind.

For the second part, the better version, its main purpose is to teach us how to organize our code in a better way, and some fundamental pracitices like autoloading. Althogh, for now, for this short project, it seems to be unnecessary to do so, in the long run, ideas learned from this part will turn out to be a powerful tool.
