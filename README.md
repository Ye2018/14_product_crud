# 14_product_crud

This project is for learning and training purpose, inspired by the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eebptXfEvw). If you like his tutorial, please give him a thumb up.

In this repository, I stored the codes I got when I followed his intructions step by step. However, since I use wamp as my local server rather than xampp, the coded stored here is a little different from the instructor's. Plus, since we are using different version of PHP, some syntax is modified. The typical thing is the use of *ternary*. Instead of:

```php

$myAge = $age ?? 18;

```

,we use:

```php

$myAge = $age ?: 18;

```

In each of the subfolder, I will write a log.md to record useful comments and links. I hope this will be helpful for the beginners like me. Let's work together for build up our own community.
