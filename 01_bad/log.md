# Useful tools & Important Concepts

## Bootstrap

It is link is [Home page of Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).  Bootstrap provides us with a lot of templates for start up our web page. In this project, *table*(color: blue;), *button* and *form* are copied and modified from bootstrap. However, bootstrap has been developed into different versions. The version used in current project is [v4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/).

If for some reason, css file provided by Bootstrap cannot be linked, we can download the file.

1. Google the CDN and Bootstrap;
2. Go to [the page of CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). Please note, we are using v4.5.3. When the video was published, there were some issues with this edition, then it was fixed;

## PDO (PHP Data Objects)

Actually, we have another way of connecting to the database, which is **MySQLi** extension (the "i" stands for improved). We can read more about this topic from [W3SCHOOL](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp).

Typtical sentences of PDO are:

```php

$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;port=3306;dbname=products_crud','root',''); // the third paramter is password. 
// For windows, it is empty
$pdo -> setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
// When there is error in the connection, just throw the exception.

//The following block of codes are to send the data to the database
$statement = $pdo -> prepare("INSERT INTO products (title, image, description, price, create_date)
            VALUES(:title, :image, :description, :price, :date)");
        // VALUE('$title', '', '$description', $price, '$date')"); The reason we don't use exec() rather
        // than prepare() is that the value to be inserted into the database directly is NOT secure. 
        // Some user may insert some SQL commands here to manage the database in the malicious ways.
$statement->bindValue(':title', $title); 
$statement->bindValue(':image', $imagePath); 
$statement->bindValue(':description', $description); 
$statement->bindValue(':price', $price); 
$statement->bindValue(':date', $date); 
$statement->execute();
```

## Super Globals

There are many useful super globals in PHP, such as

+ $_SERVER
+ $_SESSION
+ $_FILE
+ $_POST
+ $_GET
+ $_COOKIE
+ etc

Those super globals are important since they contains parameter can be used in the code to establish the complete logic. Usually, those information are organized in the form of associated array.

## Uploading Files such as an image

First of all, in the html page, we will have the form like:

```html
<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
```

with the attribute *enctype*. This attribute is telling the form a file will be uploaded here.

After this file is uploaded, if we

```php
var_dump($_FILES);
exit;
```

we will see on the webpage the content like

```php
array(1){
    ["image"]=> //This is the key, given in the form: name="image"
    array(5){
        string(27)"618FTKmhQ3L.AC_SL1500_.jpg"
        ["type"]=>
        string(10) "image/jpeg"
        ["tmp_name"]=>
        string(24)"C:\wamp64\tmp\phpE59.tmp"
        ["error"]=>
        int(0)
        ["size"]=>
        int(76118)
    }    
}
```

where "C:\wamp64\tmp\phpE59.tmp" is generated by apache.
